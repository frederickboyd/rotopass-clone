                RP currently provides users with access to a collection of
                resources, including, various communications tools, forums,
                personalized content and branded programming through its network
                of properties (the "Service"). You also understand and agree
                that the Service may include advertisements and that these
                advertisements are necessary for RP to provide the Service. You
                also understand and agree that the Service may include certain
                communications from RP, such as service announcements,
                administrative messages and that these communications are
                considered part of RP membership and you will not be able to opt
                out of receiving them. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any
                new features that augment or enhance the current Service,
                including the release of new RP properties, shall be subject to
                the Terms. You understand and agree that the Service is provided

                timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user
                communications or personalization settings. You are responsible
                for obtaining access to the Service and that access may involve
                third party fees (such as Internet service provider or airtime
                charges). You are responsible for those fees, including those
                fees associated with the display or delivery of advertisements.
                In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all
                equipment necessary to access the Service.

                you are at least 18 years of age and may legally form a binding
                contract and are not a person barred from receiving services
                under the laws of the United States or other applicable
                jurisdiction. You also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate,
